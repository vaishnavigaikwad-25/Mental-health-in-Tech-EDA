# Mental-health-in-Tech-EDA
This project explores the “Mental Health in Tech Survey 2014”, which captures self‑reported mental health status, workplace attitudes, and employer support among technology workers worldwide. The dataset includes demographic information such as age, gender, country and state, as well as job‑related variables like company size, remote work status, and whether the employer is a tech company. In addition, it records experiences and perceptions related to mental health, including family history of mental illness, whether the respondent sought treatment, perceived interference of mental health with work, availability of employer benefits, and willingness to discuss issues with coworkers or supervisors.

The primary aim of this exploratory analysis is to understand how mental health conditions and attitudes vary across demographic groups and workplace contexts, and to identify patterns that could inform employer policies. Specific questions include: How common is seeking treatment among tech workers? Does family history relate to treatment‑seeking? How do employer‑provided benefits and communication about mental health influence employees’ comfort and behaviour?

The analysis follows a structured EDA approach. First, the dataset is inspected for structure, missing values, duplicates, and outliers, with a particular focus on cleaning inconsistencies in variables such as age and gender. Next, univariate analysis summarizes distributions of key variables like treatment, work interference, benefits, and company size. Bivariate and multivariate visualizations then explore relationships between treatment and predictors such as family history, gender, geography, remote work, and employer practices around mental health benefits and wellness programs

Preliminary results suggest that a substantial proportion of respondents report having sought treatment for a mental health condition, and that treatment‑seeking is more common among those with a family history of mental illness. Many respondents work in organizations that provide some form of mental health benefits, but awareness of care options and wellness programmes is uneven, and perceptions of anonymity and ease of taking medical leave vary widely. Willingness to discuss mental health tends to be higher with close coworkers than with supervisors or potential employers, indicating persistent stigma and perceived professional risk

From a business perspective, these patterns highlight opportunities for employers to improve communication about available resources, strengthen confidentiality, and normalise conversations around mental health. By using EDA to surface such patterns, this project provides evidence‑based insights that can guide HR and leadership teams in designing more supportive policies and cultures for tech workers
